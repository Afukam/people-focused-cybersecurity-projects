# people-focused-cybersecurity-projects
My cybersecurity awareness articles, try to simplify technical jargon, making it easier to understand and implement, while keeping you entertained. At least once every month, I try to write articles that relate to real-life cybersecurity problems that people face or don't even know they do, while keeping them interested in the next lines.
